Eigen is a free C++ template math library mainly focused on vectors,
matrices, and linear algebra. It is a self-contained library covering
a very broad range of use cases. For example, it covers both dense
and sparse objects, and in the dense case, it covers both fixed-size
and dynamic-size objects. Moreover it provides linear algebra algorithms,
a geometry framework, etc. It has a very nice API for C++ programmers,
and it embraces very high performance.
