GLee provides a simple interface for using extensions and core OpenGL 
functionality beyond OpenGL version 1.1, and automates the otherwise
tedious process of linking function pointers. GLee works with both C
and C++ compilers.

Because the code is automatically generated, the latest extensions
can be included rapidly in new versions. Currently there is support 
for OpenGL up to 3.0 and almost all registered extensions. For a
complete list of extensions, please see the accompanying
extensionList.txt file.

GLFW is a free, Open Source, multi-platform library for creating
OpenGL contexts and managing input, including keyboard, mouse,
joystick and time. It is intended to be simple to integrate into
existing applications and does not lay claim to the main loop.

GLFW has native support for Windows, Mac OS X and many Unix-like
systems using the X Window System, such as Linux and FreeBSD.
